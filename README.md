# Linear-Perceptron
The neural network algorithm is the first algorithm developed as a part of the Introduction to Machine Learning course at New York University in Shanghai. 
The data set used to train the perceptron is the spam_train.txt which was split into train.txt and test.txt. Spam_test.txt was used as the final testing set.
